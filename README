dmenu - dynamic menu

dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

This is my peronal build dmenu that I use on a daily basis.

The inital patched version was generated with https://github.com/bakkeby/dmenu-flexipatch

In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

(if necessary as root):

    make clean install
